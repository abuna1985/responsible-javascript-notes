# 1 JAVASCRIPT: HANDLE WITH CARE

**NOTE:** Many wasps metaphors ahead...beware.

## WASP 1: THE _SPHEX_

The _sphex_ are solitary wasps that nest underground and prey on crickets

When _sphex_ bring crickets back to their nest, they:

1. Leave the cricket outside.
2. Conduct a nest inspection (ensure everything is in its place).
3. Come back out and drag the cricket into the nest.

**NOW** if you were to move the cricket while the _sphex_ was doing their nest inspection, they would start the process from when they initially captured the cricket. So they:

1. Notice the cricket has been moved
2. Relocate the cricket
3. Drag the cricket back to the nest entrance
4. Perform another nest inspection

## WHY AM I LEARNING ABOUT SPHEX WASPS?

This is to provide context for the made up word [spexish(credit: Douglass Hofstadter)](https://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-sph3.htm). Being **sphexish** means <q>unthinking deterministic or pre-programmed behavior, in which the wasp was at the mercy of its instincts and environment.</q>

But Mr. Hofstadter defined _spexish_ and recognized that humans also exhibit similar behavior in the book <cite>Metamagical Themas</cite>.

<blockquote cite="https://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-sph3.htm">
  <p>To the extent of having an individual style, any artist is sphexish â€” trapped within invisible, intangible, but inescapable boundaries of mental space.</p>
  <cite>Metamagical Themas</cite>, by Douglas Hofstadter, 1985.

**NOTE:** The author grumbles to himself about the developer industry's sphexishness and the ramifications it has had on the collective usability of the web.

**NOTE:** The author does not mean to say that developers are literal _sphex_ wasps who are incapable of critical thought.

**NOTE:** The author wants to recognize that we as web developers do small, consistent, and orderly tasks that can be defined as _spexish_.

## EXAMPLE OF SPEXISH BEHAVIOR IN WEB DEV

Consider:

- our attachment to best practices, even when they depreciate the user experience.
- We `npm install` packages without thinking about it and don't consider "_is there a better way than using a npm package?_"
